# EmpoweredSignalR

This library shall simplify the communication between Server and Hub. As SignalR is broadcast oriented, the request reply model was only implemented in one direction (SignalR Client -> SignalR Hub).
This library adds basic support for SignalR Hubs to request data from a SignalR client.
